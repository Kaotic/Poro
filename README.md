Poro
===============

A LoL RTMPS server emulator that will provide extra functionality to the League of Legends client via proxy.

------------------------------------

Currently using the Oceanic certificate - connect via the oceanic server on patcher. Only gets to the main menu (will time out after a while).

Requires an index.html to run at app/web. This will be included later on once the web part of Poro is completed.
